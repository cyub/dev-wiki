## C++ Annotations Version 12.5.0

 This document is intended for knowledgeable users of C (or any other language using a C-like grammar, like Perl or Java) who would like to know more about, or make the transition to, C++. This document is the main textbook for Frank's C++ programming courses, which are yearly organized at the University of Groningen. The C++ Annotations do not cover all aspects of C++, though. In particular, C++'s basic grammar is not covered when equal to C's grammar. Any basic book on C may be consulted to refresh that part of C++'s grammar.
