## Writing My Own Database From Scratch(Rust语言实现)

In this video I write my own SQL database from scratch without using any libraries or third party dependencies. Only the standard library provided by the chosen programming language is allowed (Rust in this case). The end result is a basic ACID compliant database that can process only one transaction at a time, something similar to the first versions of SQLite  from the early 2000s, but with less features (and probably much worse performance).

The goal of these videos is to provide a high level overview of how such complicated systems work internally, not explaining all the code in detail as that would require dozens of hours of content.
